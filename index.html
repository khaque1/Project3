	<p id = "bio"> Hi, welcome! My name is Kinza Haque and I am currently a first-year undergraduate student at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). I am majoring
in Information Technology and Management and minoring in Pyschology. I was born and raised in Chicago and my parents are from Pakistan. I have three 
older sisters, and together we founded a modest apparel line called "Mantled In Modesty". (Click on the link above to learn more!) In my free time,
I enjoy spending time with my family, trying out new restaurants, and baking. </p>
